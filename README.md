## Limitations

While this dashboard offers valuable insights, it's essential to be aware of its limitations:

- Some records with negative ages were excluded during querying (967 records). Ages used were 18 years and above.
- Some term dates were too far into the future and were not included in the analysis (1599 records). Only term dates up to the current date were considered.
